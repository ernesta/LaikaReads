<p>TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Tom, I&rsquo;ve a notion to skin you alive!&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Auntie, what have I done?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old softy, expecting I&rsquo;m going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she&rsquo;d found out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don&rsquo;t know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word.&rdquo;</p>


<p>This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment. Then he said:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Auntie, I wish I hadn&rsquo;t done it&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson&rsquo;s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn&rsquo;t ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn&rsquo;t mean to be mean. I didn&rsquo;t, honest. And besides, I didn&rsquo;t come over here to laugh at you that night.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;What did you come for, then?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn&rsquo;t got drownded.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never did&mdash;and I know it, Tom.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Indeed and &lsquo;deed I did, auntie&mdash;I wish I may never stir if I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, don&rsquo;t lie&mdash;don&rsquo;t do it. It only makes things a hundred times worse.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a lie, auntie; it&rsquo;s the truth. I wanted to keep you from grieving&mdash;that was all that made me come.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give the whole world to believe that&mdash;it would cover up a power of sins, Tom. I&rsquo;d &lsquo;most be glad you&rsquo;d run off and acted so bad. But it ain&rsquo;t reasonable; because, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me, child?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn&rsquo;t somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;What bark?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;The bark I had wrote on to tell you we&rsquo;d gone pirating. I wish, now, you&rsquo;d waked up when I kissed you&mdash;I do, honest.&rdquo;</p>


<p>The hard lines in his aunt&rsquo;s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes.</p>


<p>&ldquo;<i>Did</i> you kiss me, Tom?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I did.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you did, Tom?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I did, auntie&mdash;certain sure.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;What did you kiss me for, Tom?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.&rdquo;</p>


<p>The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Kiss me again, Tom!&mdash;and be off with you to school, now, and don&rsquo;t bother me any more.&rdquo;</p>


<p>The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her hand, and said to herself:</p>


<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he&rsquo;s lied about it&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a blessed, blessed lie, there&rsquo;s such a comfort come from it. I hope the Lord&mdash;I <i>know</i> the Lord will forgive him, because it was such good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don&rsquo;t want to find out it&rsquo;s a lie. I won&rsquo;t look.&rdquo;</p>


<p>She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good lie&mdash;it&rsquo;s a good lie&mdash;I won&rsquo;t let it grieve me.&rdquo; So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom&rsquo;s piece of bark through flowing tears and saying: &ldquo;I could forgive the boy, now, if he&rsquo;d committed a million sins!&rdquo;</p>
