<p>&lsquo;Your majesty shouldn&rsquo;t purr so loud,&rsquo; Alice said, rubbing her eyes, and addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. &lsquo;You woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And you&rsquo;ve been along with me, Kitty&mdash;all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?&rsquo;</p>


<p>It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the remark) that, whatever you say to them, they <i>always</i> purr. &lsquo;If they would only purr for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and mew for &ldquo;no,&rdquo; or any rule of that sort,&rsquo; she had said, &lsquo;so that one could keep up a conversation! But how <i>can</i> you talk with a person if they always say the same thing?&rsquo;</p>


<p>On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess whether it meant &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no.&rsquo;</p>


<p>So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. &lsquo;Now, Kitty!&rsquo; she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly. &lsquo;Confess that was what you turned into!&rsquo;</p>


<p>(&lsquo;But it wouldn&rsquo;t look at it,&rsquo; she said, when she was explaining the thing afterwards to her sister: &lsquo;it turned away its head, and pretended not to see it: but it looked a <i>little</i> ashamed of itself, so I think it <i>must</i> have been the Red Queen.&rsquo;)</p>


<p>&lsquo;Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!&rsquo; Alice cried with a merry laugh. &lsquo;And curtsey while you&rsquo;re thinking what to&mdash;what to purr. It saves time, remember!&rsquo; And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, &lsquo;just in honour of having been a Red Queen.&rsquo;</p>


<p>&lsquo;Snowdrop, my pet!&rsquo; she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, &lsquo;when <i>will</i> Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must be the reason you were so untidy in my dream&mdash;Dinah! do you know that you&rsquo;re scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it&rsquo;s most disrespectful of you!</p>


<p>&lsquo;And what did <i>Dinah</i> turn to, I wonder?&rsquo; she prattled on, as she settled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand, to watch the kittens. &lsquo;Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty Dumpty? I <i>think</i> you did&mdash;however, you&rsquo;d better not mention it to your friends just yet, for I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>


<p>&lsquo;By the way, Kitty, if only you&rsquo;d been really with me in my dream, there was one thing you <i>would</i> have enjoyed&mdash;I had such a quantity of poetry said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real treat. All the time you&rsquo;re eating your breakfast, I&rsquo;ll repeat &ldquo;The Walrus and the Carpenter&rdquo; to you; and then you can make believe it&rsquo;s oysters, dear!</p>


<p>&lsquo;Now, Kitty, let&rsquo;s consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a serious question, my dear, and you should <i>not</i> go on licking your paw like that&mdash;as if Dinah hadn&rsquo;t washed you this morning! You see, Kitty, it <i>must</i> have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream, of course&mdash;but then I was part of his dream, too! <i>Was</i> it the Red King, Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know&mdash;Oh, Kitty, <i>do</i> help to settle it! I&rsquo;m sure your paw can wait!&rsquo; But the provoking kitten only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn&rsquo;t heard the question.</p>


<p>Which do <i>you</i> think it was?</p>


<p class="stanza">A boat beneath a sunny sky,<br>
Lingering onward dreamily<br>
In an evening of July&mdash;</p>


<p class="stanza">Children three that nestle near,<br>
Eager eye and willing ear,<br>
Pleased a simple tale to hear&mdash;</p>


<p class="stanza">Long has paled that sunny sky:<br>
Echoes fade and memories die.<br>
Autumn frosts have slain July.</p>


<p class="stanza">Still she haunts me, phantomwise,<br>
Alice moving under skies<br>
Never seen by waking eyes.</p>


<p class="stanza">Children yet, the tale to hear,<br>
Eager eye and willing ear,<br>
Lovingly shall nestle near.</p>


<p class="stanza">In a Wonderland they lie,<br>
Dreaming as the days go by,<br>
Dreaming as the summers die:</p>


<p class="stanza">Ever drifting down the stream&mdash;<br>
Lingering in the golden gleam&mdash;<br>
Life, what is it but a dream?</p>


<p class="end">THE END</p>
