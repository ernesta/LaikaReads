<p>When they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Tryin&rsquo; to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! Tired of our company, hey?&rdquo;</p>


<p>I says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;No, your majesty, we warn&rsquo;t&mdash;<i>please</i> don&rsquo;t, your majesty!&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Quick, then, and tell us what <i>was</i> your idea, or I&rsquo;ll shake the insides out o&rsquo; you!&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Honest, I&rsquo;ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty. The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and whispers, &lsquo;Heel it now, or they&rsquo;ll hang ye, sure!&rsquo; and I lit out. It didn&rsquo;t seem no good for <i>me</i> to stay&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t do nothing, and I didn&rsquo;t want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they&rsquo;d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn&rsquo;t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, &ldquo;Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s <i>mighty</i> likely!&rdquo; and shook me up again, and said he reckoned he&rsquo;d drownd me. But the duke says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would <i>you</i> a done any different? Did you inquire around for <i>him</i> when you got loose? I don&rsquo;t remember it.&rdquo;</p>


<p>So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it. But the duke says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;You better a blame&rsquo; sight give <i>yourself</i> a good cussing, for you&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s entitled to it most. You hain&rsquo;t done a thing from the start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That <i>was</i> bright&mdash;it was right down bully; and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that they&rsquo;d a jailed us till them Englishmen&rsquo;s baggage come&mdash;and then&mdash;the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took &lsquo;em to the graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn&rsquo;t let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we&rsquo;d a slept in our cravats to-night&mdash;cravats warranted to <i>wear</i>, too&mdash;longer than <i>we&rsquo;d</i> need &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>


<p>They was still a minute&mdash;thinking; then the king says, kind of absent-minded like:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Mf! And we reckoned the <i>niggers</i> stole it!&rdquo;</p>


<p>That made me squirm!</p>


<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, &ldquo;<i>we</i> did.&rdquo;</p>


<p>After about a half a minute the king drawls out:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Leastways, I did.&rdquo;</p>


<p>The duke says, the same way:</p>


<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I did.&rdquo;</p>


<p>The king kind of ruffles up, and says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Looky here, Bilgewater, what&rsquo;r you referrin&rsquo; to?&rdquo;</p>


<p>The duke says, pretty brisk:</p>


<p>&ldquo;When it comes to that, maybe you&rsquo;ll let me ask, what was <i>you</i> referring to?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; says the king, very sarcastic; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;maybe you was asleep, and didn&rsquo;t know what you was about.&rdquo;</p>


<p>The duke bristles up now, and says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, let <i>up</i> on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame&rsquo; fool? Don&rsquo;t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>, sir! I know you <i>do</i> know, because you done it yourself!&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo;&mdash;and the duke went for him. The king sings out:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Take y&rsquo;r hands off!&mdash;leggo my throat!&mdash;I take it all back!&rdquo;</p>


<p>The duke says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, you just own up, first, that you <i>did</i> hide that money there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it up, and have it all to yourself.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Wait jest a minute, duke&mdash;answer me this one question, honest and fair; if you didn&rsquo;t put the money there, say it, and I&rsquo;ll b&rsquo;lieve you, and take back everything I said.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;You old scoundrel, I didn&rsquo;t, and you know I didn&rsquo;t. There, now!&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I b&rsquo;lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more&mdash;now <i>don&rsquo;t</i> git mad; didn&rsquo;t you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it?&rdquo;</p>


<p>The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care if I <i>did</i>, I didn&rsquo;t <i>do</i> it, anyway. But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you <i>done</i> it.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that&rsquo;s honest. I won&rsquo;t say I warn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to do it, because I <i>was</i>; but you&mdash;I mean somebody&mdash;got in ahead o&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie! You done it, and you got to <i>say</i> you done it, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>


<p>The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:</p>


<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nough!&mdash;I <i>own up!</i>&rdquo;</p>


<p>I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;If you ever deny it again I&rsquo;ll drown you. It&rsquo;s <i>well</i> for you to set there and blubber like a baby&mdash;it&rsquo;s fitten for you, after the way you&rsquo;ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything&mdash;and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for &lsquo;em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to <i>believe</i> that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit&mdash;you wanted to get what money I&rsquo;d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it <i>all</i>!&rdquo;</p>


<p>The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn&rsquo;t me.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Dry up! I don&rsquo;t want to hear no more out of you!&rdquo; says the duke. "And <i>now</i> you see what you GOT by it. They&rsquo;ve got all their own money back, and all of <i>ourn</i> but a shekel or two <i>besides</i>. G&rsquo;long to bed, and don&rsquo;t you deffersit <i>me</i> no more deffersits, long &lsquo;s <i>you</i> live!&rdquo;</p>


<p>So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other&rsquo;s arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn&rsquo;t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.</p>
