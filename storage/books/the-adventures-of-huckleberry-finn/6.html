<p>WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don&rsquo;t reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t take no stock in mathematics, anyway.</p>


<p>At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up. &nbsp;So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be. &nbsp;I was getting sort of used to the widow&rsquo;s ways, too, and they warn&rsquo;t so raspy on me. &nbsp;Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest to me. &nbsp;I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. &nbsp;She said she warn&rsquo;t ashamed of me.</p>


<p>One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. &nbsp;I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, &ldquo;Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!&rdquo; &nbsp;The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn&rsquo;t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. &nbsp;I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. &nbsp;There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn&rsquo;t one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.</p>


<p>I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence. &nbsp;There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebody&rsquo;s tracks. &nbsp;They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden fence. &nbsp;It was funny they hadn&rsquo;t come in, after standing around so. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t make it out. &nbsp;It was very curious, somehow. &nbsp;I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t notice anything at first, but next I did. &nbsp;There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.</p>


<p>I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. &nbsp;I looked over my shoulder every now and then, but I didn&rsquo;t see nobody. &nbsp;I was at Judge Thatcher&rsquo;s as quick as I could get there. &nbsp;He said:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. &nbsp;Did you come for your interest?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;is there some for me?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night&mdash;over a hundred and fifty dollars. &nbsp;Quite a fortune for you. &nbsp;You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you&rsquo;ll spend it.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spend it. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want it at all&mdash;nor the six thousand, nuther. &nbsp;I want you to take it; I want to give it to you&mdash;the six thousand and all.&rdquo;</p>


<p>He looked surprised. &nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t seem to make it out. &nbsp;He says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Why, what can you mean, my boy?&rdquo;</p>


<p>I says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ask me no questions about it, please. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll take it&mdash;won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>


<p>He says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m puzzled. &nbsp;Is something the matter?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Please take it,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t ask me nothing&mdash;then I won&rsquo;t have to tell no lies.&rdquo;</p>


<p>He studied a while, and then he says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Oho-o! &nbsp;I think I see. &nbsp;You want to <i>sell</i> all your property to me&mdash;not give it. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the correct idea.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;There; you see it says &lsquo;for a consideration.&rsquo; &nbsp;That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a dollar for you. &nbsp;Now you sign it.&rdquo;</p>


<p>So I signed it, and left.</p>


<p>Miss Watson&rsquo;s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with it. &nbsp;He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed everything. &nbsp;So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow. &nbsp;What I wanted to know was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? &nbsp;Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor. &nbsp;It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch. &nbsp;Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. &nbsp;Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened. &nbsp;But it warn&rsquo;t no use; he said it wouldn&rsquo;t talk. He said sometimes it wouldn&rsquo;t talk without money. &nbsp;I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn&rsquo;t no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn&rsquo;t pass nohow, even if the brass didn&rsquo;t show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. &nbsp;(I reckoned I wouldn&rsquo;t say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference. &nbsp;Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. &nbsp;He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn&rsquo;t see no brass, and it wouldn&rsquo;t feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball. &nbsp;Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.</p>


<p>Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right. &nbsp;He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to. &nbsp;I says, go on. &nbsp;So the hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. &nbsp;He says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; ole father doan&rsquo; know yit what he&rsquo;s a-gwyne to do. &nbsp;Sometimes he spec he&rsquo;ll go &lsquo;way, en den agin he spec he&rsquo;ll stay. &nbsp;De bes&rsquo; way is to res&rsquo; easy en let de ole man take his own way. &nbsp;Dey&rsquo;s two angels hoverin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; &lsquo;bout him. &nbsp;One uv &lsquo;em is white en shiny, en t&rsquo;other one is black. De white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail in en bust it all up. &nbsp;A body can&rsquo;t tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las&rsquo;. &nbsp;But you is all right. &nbsp;You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo&rsquo; life, en considable joy. &nbsp;Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you&rsquo;s gwyne to git well agin. &nbsp;Dey&rsquo;s two gals flyin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout you in yo&rsquo; life. &nbsp;One uv &lsquo;em&rsquo;s light en t&rsquo;other one is dark. One is rich en t&rsquo;other is po&rsquo;. &nbsp;You&rsquo;s gwyne to marry de po&rsquo; one fust en de rich one by en by. &nbsp;You wants to keep &lsquo;way fum de water as much as you kin, en don&rsquo;t run no resk, &lsquo;kase it&rsquo;s down in de bills dat you&rsquo;s gwyne to git hung.&rdquo;</p>


<p>When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his own self!</p>
