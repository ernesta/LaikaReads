<p>WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was after. &nbsp;We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.</p>


<p>Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead to tie to, for it wouldn&rsquo;t do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn&rsquo;t anything but little saplings to tie to. &nbsp;I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went. &nbsp;I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn&rsquo;t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me&mdash;and then there warn&rsquo;t no raft in sight; you couldn&rsquo;t see twenty yards. &nbsp;I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. &nbsp;But she didn&rsquo;t come. &nbsp;I was in such a hurry I hadn&rsquo;t untied her. &nbsp;I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn&rsquo;t hardly do anything with them.</p>


<p>As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right down the towhead. &nbsp;That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead warn&rsquo;t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn&rsquo;t no more idea which way I was going than a dead man.</p>


<p>Thinks I, it won&rsquo;t do to paddle; first I know I&rsquo;ll run into the bank or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it&rsquo;s mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time. &nbsp;I whooped and listened. &nbsp;Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. &nbsp;I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. &nbsp;The next time it come I see I warn&rsquo;t heading for it, but heading away to the right of it. &nbsp;And the next time I was heading away to the left of it&mdash;and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t&rsquo;other, but it was going straight ahead all the time.</p>


<p>I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. &nbsp;Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop <i>behind</i> me. &nbsp;I was tangled good now. &nbsp;That was somebody else&rsquo;s whoop, or else I was turned around.</p>


<p>I throwed the paddle down. &nbsp;I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe&rsquo;s head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don&rsquo;t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.</p>


<p>The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.</p>


<p>In another second or two it was solid white and still again. &nbsp;I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn&rsquo;t draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.</p>


<p>I just give up then. &nbsp;I knowed what the matter was. &nbsp;That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t&rsquo;other side of it. &nbsp;It warn&rsquo;t no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. &nbsp;It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.</p>


<p>I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. &nbsp;I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don&rsquo;t ever think of that. &nbsp;No, you <i>feel</i> like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don&rsquo;t think to yourself how fast <i>you&rsquo;re</i> going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag&rsquo;s tearing along. &nbsp;If you think it ain&rsquo;t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see.</p>


<p>Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn&rsquo;t do it, and directly I judged I&rsquo;d got into a nest of towheads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me&mdash;sometimes just a narrow channel between, and some that I couldn&rsquo;t see I knowed was there because I&rsquo;d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks. &nbsp;Well, I warn&rsquo;t long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o&rsquo;-lantern. &nbsp;You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.</p>


<p>I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing&mdash;it was floating a little faster than what I was.</p>


<p>Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn&rsquo;t hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. &nbsp;I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. &nbsp;I was good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn&rsquo;t bother no more. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn&rsquo;t help it; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.</p>


<p>But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend stern first. &nbsp;First I didn&rsquo;t know where I was; I thought I was dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week.</p>


<p>It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see by the stars. &nbsp;I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn&rsquo;t nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together. &nbsp;Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this time I was right. &nbsp;It was the raft.</p>


<p>When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. &nbsp;The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt. &nbsp;So she&rsquo;d had a rough time.</p>


<p>I made fast and laid down under Jim&rsquo;s nose on the raft, and began to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? &nbsp;Why didn&rsquo;t you stir me up?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? &nbsp;En you ain&rsquo; dead&mdash;you ain&rsquo; drownded&mdash;you&rsquo;s back agin? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s too good for true, honey, it&rsquo;s too good for true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o&rsquo; you. &nbsp;No, you ain&rsrsquo; dead! you&rsquo;s back agin, &lsquo;live en soun&rsquo;, jis de same ole Huck&mdash;de same ole Huck, thanks to goodness!&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, Jim? &nbsp;You been a-drinking?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Drinkin&rsquo;? &nbsp;Has I ben a-drinkin&rsquo;? &nbsp;Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;How does I talk wild?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;<i>How</i>? &nbsp;Why, hain&rsquo;t you been talking about my coming back, and all that stuff, as if I&rsquo;d been gone away?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Huck&mdash;Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. &nbsp;<i>Hain&rsquo;t</i> you ben gone away?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Gone away? &nbsp;Why, what in the nation do you mean? &nbsp;I hain&rsquo;t been gone anywheres. &nbsp;Where would I go to?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, looky here, boss, dey&rsquo;s sumf&rsquo;n wrong, dey is. &nbsp;Is I <i>me</i>, or who <i>is</i> I? Is I heah, or whah <i>is</i> I? &nbsp;Now dat&rsquo;s what I wants to know.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you&rsquo;re here, plain enough, but I think you&rsquo;re a tangle-headed old fool, Jim.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;I is, is I? &nbsp;Well, you answer me dis: &nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas&rsquo; to de tow-head?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;What tow-head? &nbsp;I hain&rsquo;t see no tow-head.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;You hain&rsquo;t seen no towhead? &nbsp;Looky here, didn&rsquo;t de line pull loose en de raf&rsquo; go a-hummin&rsquo; down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;What fog?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Why, de fog!&mdash;de fog dat&rsquo;s been aroun&rsquo; all night. &nbsp;En didn&rsquo;t you whoop, en didn&rsquo;t I whoop, tell we got mix&rsquo; up in de islands en one un us got los&rsquo; en t&rsquo;other one was jis&rsquo; as good as los&rsquo;, &lsquo;kase he didn&rsquo; know whah he wuz? En didn&rsquo;t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos&rsquo; git drownded? &nbsp;Now ain&rsquo; dat so, boss&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it so? &nbsp;You answer me dat.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, this is too many for me, Jim. &nbsp;I hain&rsquo;t seen no fog, nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. &nbsp;I been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon I done the same. &nbsp;You couldn&rsquo;t a got drunk in that time, so of course you&rsquo;ve been dreaming.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn&rsquo;t any of it happen.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;But, Huck, it&rsquo;s all jis&rsquo; as plain to me as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make no difference how plain it is; there ain&rsquo;t nothing in it. I know, because I&rsquo;ve been here all the time.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Jim didn&rsquo;t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying over it. &nbsp;Then he says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, den, I reck&rsquo;n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain&rsquo;t de powerfullest dream I ever see. &nbsp;En I hain&rsquo;t ever had no dream b&rsquo;fo&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s tired me like dis one.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s all right, because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes. &nbsp;But this one was a staving dream; tell me all about it, Jim.&rdquo;</p>


<p>So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it happened, only he painted it up considerable. &nbsp;Then he said he must start in and &ldquo;&lsquo;terpret&rdquo; it, because it was sent for a warning. &nbsp;He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but the current was another man that would get us away from him. &nbsp;The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn&rsquo;t try hard to make out to understand them they&rsquo;d just take us into bad luck, &lsquo;stead of keeping us out of it. &nbsp;The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn&rsquo;t talk back and aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn&rsquo;t have no more trouble.</p>


<p>It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it was clearing up again now.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;but what does <i>these</i> things stand for?&rdquo;</p>


<p>It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. &nbsp;You could see them first-rate now.</p>


<p>Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash again. &nbsp;He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn&rsquo;t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away. &nbsp;But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;What do dey stan&rsquo; for? &nbsp;I&rsquo;se gwyne to tell you. &nbsp;When I got all wore out wid work, en wid de callin&rsquo; for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos&rsquo; broke bekase you wuz los&rsquo;, en I didn&rsquo; k&rsquo;yer no&rsquo; mo&rsquo; what become er me en de raf&rsquo;. &nbsp;En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe en soun&rsquo;, de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo&rsquo; foot, I&rsquo;s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. &nbsp;Dat truck dah is <i>trash</i>; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren&rsquo;s en makes &lsquo;em ashamed.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without saying anything but that. &nbsp;But that was enough. &nbsp;It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed <i>his</i> foot to get him to take it back.</p>


<p>It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn&rsquo;t ever sorry for it afterwards, neither. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t do him no more mean tricks, and I wouldn&rsquo;t done that one if I&rsquo;d a knowed it would make him feel that way.</p>
