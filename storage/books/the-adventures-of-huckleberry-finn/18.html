<p>WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. &nbsp;She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely. &nbsp;She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. &nbsp;There was a power of style about her. &nbsp;It <i>amounted</i> to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.</p>


<p>We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. &nbsp;The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn&rsquo;t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. &nbsp;We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it. &nbsp;I said likely we wouldn&rsquo;t, because I had heard say there warn&rsquo;t but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn&rsquo;t happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? &nbsp;Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. &nbsp;But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim&mdash;and me too. &nbsp;So the question was, what to do? &nbsp;I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. &nbsp;Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited.</p>


<p>There warn&rsquo;t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and not pass it without seeing it. &nbsp;He said he&rsquo;d be mighty sure to see it, because he&rsquo;d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he&rsquo;d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. &nbsp;Every little while he jumps up and says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Dah she is?&rdquo;</p>


<p>But it warn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;It was Jack-o&rsquo;-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. &nbsp;Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. &nbsp;Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he <i>was</i> most free&mdash;and who was to blame for it? &nbsp;Why, <i>me</i>. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn&rsquo;t rest; I couldn&rsquo;t stay still in one place. &nbsp;It hadn&rsquo;t ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. &nbsp;But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. &nbsp;I tried to make out to myself that I warn&rsquo;t to blame, because I didn&rsquo;t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn&rsquo;t no use, conscience up and says, every time, &ldquo;But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.&rdquo; &nbsp;That was so&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t get around that noway. &nbsp;That was where it pinched. &nbsp;Conscience says to me, &ldquo;What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? &nbsp;What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? &nbsp;Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. &nbsp;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> what she done.&rdquo;</p>


<p>I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. &nbsp;I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. &nbsp;We neither of us could keep still. &nbsp;Every time he danced around and says, &ldquo;Dah&rsquo;s Cairo!&rdquo; it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it <i>was</i> Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.</p>


<p>Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. &nbsp;He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn&rsquo;t sell them, they&rsquo;d get an Ab&rsquo;litionist to go and steal them.</p>


<p>It most froze me to hear such talk. &nbsp;He wouldn&rsquo;t ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. &nbsp;Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. &nbsp;It was according to the old saying, &ldquo;Give a nigger an inch and he&rsquo;ll take an ell.&rdquo; &nbsp;Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. &nbsp;Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children&mdash;children that belonged to a man I didn&rsquo;t even know; a man that hadn&rsquo;t ever done me no harm.</p>


<p>I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. &nbsp;My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, &ldquo;Let up on me&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t too late yet&mdash;I&rsquo;ll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.&rdquo; &nbsp;I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off. &nbsp;All my troubles was gone. &nbsp;I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. &nbsp;By and by one showed. &nbsp;Jim sings out:</p>


<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;s safe, Huck, we&rsquo;s safe! &nbsp;Jump up and crack yo&rsquo; heels! &nbsp;Dat&rsquo;s de good ole Cairo at las&rsquo;, I jis knows it!&rdquo;</p>


<p>I says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. &nbsp;It mightn&rsquo;t be, you know.&rdquo;</p>


<p>He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Pooty soon I&rsquo;ll be a-shout&rsquo;n&rsquo; for joy, en I&rsquo;ll say, it&rsquo;s all on accounts o&rsquo; Huck; I&rsquo;s a free man, en I couldn&rsquo;t ever ben free ef it hadn&rsquo; ben for Huck; Huck done it. &nbsp;Jim won&rsquo;t ever forgit you, Huck; you&rsquo;s de bes&rsquo; fren&rsquo; Jim&rsquo;s ever had; en you&rsquo;s de <i>only</i> fren&rsquo; ole Jim&rsquo;s got now.&rdquo;</p>


<p>I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. &nbsp;I went along slow then, and I warn&rsquo;t right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on&rsquo;y white genlman dat ever kep&rsquo; his promise to ole Jim.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Well, I just felt sick. &nbsp;But I says, I <i>got</i> to do it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t get <i>out</i> of it. &nbsp;Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. &nbsp;One of them says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that yonder?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;A piece of a raft,&rdquo; I says.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Do you belong on it?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Any men on it?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Only one, sir.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head of the bend. &nbsp;Is your man white or black?&rdquo;</p>


<p>I didn&rsquo;t answer up prompt. &nbsp;I tried to, but the words wouldn&rsquo;t come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn&rsquo;t man enough&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t the spunk of a rabbit. &nbsp;I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s white.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;ll go and see for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s pap that&rsquo;s there, and maybe you&rsquo;d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s sick&mdash;and so is mam and Mary Ann.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, the devil! we&rsquo;re in a hurry, boy. &nbsp;But I s&rsquo;pose we&rsquo;ve got to. &nbsp;Come, buckle to your paddle, and let&rsquo;s get along.&rdquo;</p>


<p>I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. &nbsp;When we had made a stroke or two, I says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Pap&rsquo;ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. &nbsp;Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can&rsquo;t do it by myself.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s infernal mean. &nbsp;Odd, too. &nbsp;Say, boy, what&rsquo;s the matter with your father?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the&mdash;a&mdash;the&mdash;well, it ain&rsquo;t anything much.&rdquo;</p>


<p>They stopped pulling. &nbsp;It warn&rsquo;t but a mighty little ways to the raft now. One says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Boy, that&rsquo;s a lie. &nbsp;What <i>is</i> the matter with your pap? &nbsp;Answer up square now, and it&rsquo;ll be the better for you.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;I will, sir, I will, honest&mdash;but don&rsquo;t leave us, please. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the&mdash;the&mdash;Gentlemen, if you&rsquo;ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won&rsquo;t have to come a-near the raft&mdash;please do.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Set her back, John, set her back!&rdquo; says one. &nbsp;They backed water. &nbsp;\"Keep away, boy&mdash;keep to looard. &nbsp;Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. &nbsp;Your pap&rsquo;s got the small-pox, and you know it precious well. &nbsp;Why didn&rsquo;t you come out and say so? &nbsp;Do you want to spread it all over?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, a-blubbering, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told everybody before, and they just went away and left us.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Poor devil, there&rsquo;s something in that. &nbsp;We are right down sorry for you, but we&mdash;well, hang it, we don&rsquo;t want the small-pox, you see. &nbsp;Look here, I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you try to land by yourself, or you&rsquo;ll smash everything to pieces. &nbsp;You float along down about twenty miles, and you&rsquo;ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. &nbsp;It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. &nbsp;Now we&rsquo;re trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that&rsquo;s a good boy. &nbsp;It wouldn&rsquo;t do any good to land yonder where the light is&mdash;it&rsquo;s only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father&rsquo;s poor, and I&rsquo;m bound to say he&rsquo;s in pretty hard luck. &nbsp;Here, I&rsquo;ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by. &nbsp;I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom! it won&rsquo;t do to fool with small-pox, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Parker,&rdquo; says the other man, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a twenty to put on the board for me. &nbsp;Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, my boy&mdash;good-bye, good-bye. &nbsp;If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, sir,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>


<p>They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn&rsquo;t no use for me to try to learn to do right; a body that don&rsquo;t get <i>started</i> right when he&rsquo;s little ain&rsquo;t got no show&mdash;when the pinch comes there ain&rsquo;t nothing to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat. &nbsp;Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;d a done right and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now? &nbsp;No, says I, I&rsquo;d feel bad&mdash;I&rsquo;d feel just the same way I do now. &nbsp;Well, then, says I, what&rsquo;s the use you learning to do right when it&rsquo;s troublesome to do right and ain&rsquo;t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same? &nbsp;I was stuck. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t answer that. &nbsp;So I reckoned I wouldn&rsquo;t bother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time.</p>


<p>I went into the wigwam; Jim warn&rsquo;t there. &nbsp;I looked all around; he warn&rsquo;t anywhere. &nbsp;I says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Here I is, Huck. &nbsp;Is dey out o&rsquo; sight yit? &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t talk loud.&rdquo;</p>


<p>He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. &nbsp;I told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard. &nbsp;He says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;I was a-listenin&rsquo; to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho&rsquo; if dey come aboard. &nbsp;Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf&rsquo; agin when dey was gone. &nbsp;But lawsy, how you did fool &lsquo;em, Huck! &nbsp;Dat <i>wuz</i> de smartes&rsquo; dodge! &nbsp;I tell you, chile, I&rsquo;spec it save&rsquo; ole Jim&mdash;ole Jim ain&rsquo;t going to forgit you for dat, honey.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Then we talked about the money. &nbsp;It was a pretty good raise&mdash;twenty dollars apiece. &nbsp;Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more warn&rsquo;t far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there.</p>


<p>Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good. &nbsp;Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting.</p>


<p>That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend.</p>


<p>I went off in the canoe to ask about it. &nbsp;Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. &nbsp;I ranged up and says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Mister, is that town Cairo?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Cairo? no. &nbsp;You must be a blame&rsquo; fool.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;What town is it, mister?&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;If you want to know, go and find out. &nbsp;If you stay here botherin&rsquo; around me for about a half a minute longer you&rsquo;ll get something you won&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p>


<p>I paddled to the raft. &nbsp;Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.</p>


<p>We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was high ground, so I didn&rsquo;t go. &nbsp;No high ground about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it. &nbsp;We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank. &nbsp;I begun to suspicion something. &nbsp;So did Jim. &nbsp;I says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.&rdquo;</p>


<p>He says:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo; le&rsquo;s talk about it, Huck. &nbsp;Po&rsquo; niggers can&rsquo;t have no luck. &nbsp;I awluz &lsquo;spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn&rsquo;t done wid its work.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never seen that snake-skin, Jim&mdash;I do wish I&rsquo;d never laid eyes on it.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; fault, Huck; you didn&rsquo; know. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you blame yo&rsquo;self &lsquo;bout it.&rdquo;</p>


<p>When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! &nbsp;So it was all up with Cairo.</p>


<p>We talked it all over. &nbsp;It wouldn&rsquo;t do to take to the shore; we couldn&rsquo;t take the raft up the stream, of course. &nbsp;There warn&rsquo;t no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. &nbsp;So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!</p>


<p>We didn&rsquo;t say a word for a good while. &nbsp;There warn&rsquo;t anything to say. &nbsp;We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? &nbsp;It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck&mdash;and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.</p>


<p>By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn&rsquo;t no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in. &nbsp;We warn&rsquo;t going to borrow it when there warn&rsquo;t anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us.</p>


<p>So we shoved out after dark on the raft.</p>


<p>Anybody that don&rsquo;t believe yet that it&rsquo;s foolishness to handle a snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us.</p>


<p>The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. &nbsp;But we didn&rsquo;t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and more. &nbsp;Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t tell the shape of the river, and you can&rsquo;t see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. &nbsp;We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it. &nbsp;Up-stream boats didn&rsquo;t generly come close to us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.</p>


<p>We could hear her pounding along, but we didn&rsquo;t see her good till she was close. &nbsp;She aimed right for us. &nbsp;Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he&rsquo;s mighty smart. &nbsp;Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to try and shave us; but she didn&rsquo;t seem to be sheering off a bit. &nbsp;She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us. &nbsp;There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam&mdash;and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through the raft.</p>


<p>I dived&mdash;and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. &nbsp;I could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half. &nbsp;Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. &nbsp;I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. &nbsp;Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her.</p>


<p>I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn&rsquo;t get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was &ldquo;treading water,&rdquo; and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. &nbsp;But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.</p>


<p>It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over. &nbsp;I made a safe landing, and clumb up the bank. I couldn&rsquo;t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. &nbsp;I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.</p>
